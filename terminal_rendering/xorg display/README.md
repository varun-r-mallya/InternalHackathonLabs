##Failed idea
We thought of making a terminal renderer for GUI programs.
We were thinking of using xvfb, a virtual frame buffer.
It gave up on us and we gave up on it when we found out that it isnt really maintained properly and there much better replacements for it.

This folder contains the c++ code written to log mouse clicks with coordinates on terminal and the code written to run xorg in the virtual frame buffer (this is the code that did not work).

<code>main.ipynb</code> contains the code written to make images off the virtual frame buffer.
